 Indiranagar

Like the area surrounding any college, the streets around Indiranagar are dotted with a variety of
eateries and street food stalls patronised for good reason by the students whom they serve.
Here are a few that you could check out:

>Hatti Kaapi – Superlative filter coffee. Best of South-Indian tiffin snacks – Maddur Vada, Masala
Bun, Vada Pao, Idly, Vada. Hazelnut Cold Coffee.

>Khawa Karpo – Hole-in-the-wall Tibetan joint frequented by students. Thukpa, Honey Potato
Wedges, Ting-Mo and Chicken Shap-tak.

>Juice Junction – Freshly prepared fruit juices, fruit salad.
Soori Chats – South-Indian Bhel Puri.

String them together to form the Indiranagar. This area is full of eateries of varying budgets. Among
the mid-range restaurants you could also try Meghana Biryani for Andhra style biryani, Empire
Restaurant for Dosa Chicken and Truffles Ice and Spice for continental cuisine.

VV Puram 

is Bangalore’s most famous Food Street and a complete must-do for anyone visiting or
staying in Bangalore. Till you get there and try the food, you really don’t know what you’re missing.
This guide attempts to cover almost each of the outlets starting from when one enters the street at
Sajjan Rao Circle. Before that a few basic guidelines about this food street and what we suggest
you keep in mind while planning this gastronomical adventure.
To taste maximum number of dishes and make the most of this trail, do it in a group of 8 or more
people (who do not mind sharing food). There is so much on offer that just a couple of bites of
the top items at each joint will fill you up to a point when the senses may crave but the stomach
will refuse to take in any more. No point eating one or two items and heading back, we say.
VV Puram comes alive around 7:30 – 8:00 in the evening. While some of the shops start serving
from 5:30-6:00 PM onwards, all of them are ready only by 7:00 PM.
Weekends are extremely crowded so get there a little early. The crowds can mean having to wait
a fair bit of time at some of the shops.
Finding parking is not extremely easy on weekends – try one of the roads leading into Sajjan Rao
Circle if you can’t find parking around the circle itself.
Do use dustbins to dispose of the plates etc. Most shops will have dustbins placed at prominent
locations.
Try and avoid wasting food.

Not-what-this-street-is-known-for but can-try shops because their food is good:
• Mumbai Pao Bhaji, Dabeli, Tawa Pulao,
•Punjabi chaats (pani puri, papdi chaat, bread pakora, cutlets)
•Paranthas / Rajasthani roti sabzi,
•Lassi / Rose Milk / Kulfi
•Chinese
•Sandwiches


Now a quick overview of the food before we get into the specifics of what each of the joints serve.
There are about 15 outlets serving different types of food (listed below outlet by outlet). We would
classify the food varieties into the following categories in decreasing order of specialty – from must-
have to do-try to not-what-this-is-known-for. That is not to say that food listed in the last category is
not good – it’s just not what this street is known for. Also, some of those in the last category are
relatively new additions to this otherwise old food street, and purists that we are, we would like to
call them out.

Koramangala

Koramangala is another of Bangalore’s hip and happening party and food districts, housing
restaurants specializing in any cuisine you can think of. It is 4 kms from Royal Orchid down a
straight road – the intermediate ring road. Koramangala has super interesting street-side joints,
standing shoulder to shoulder with their more sophisticated, up-market cousins. An interesting
Rajasthani place, a hole-in-the-wall Tibetian joint, Bhajji Carts, Pao Bhaji vans ... lots to explore in
this part of the city.
(Quick advice on the traffic scene. Getting from Royal Orchid to Koramangala can take anywhere
from 7 mins to 45 mins – it is a simple function of the time of day and traffic scenario. During office
hours (read 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM) the 45 min time frame is what you
should budget for.)
It’s worth splitting Koramangala into two sections. The area around Jyoti Nivas College has a
buzzing student vibe. Then there is 80 ft Rd Koramangala that has what could be called the
Koramangala Food Street for the string of street-side food stalls it hosts. (Koramangala actually
had a food street (read about it here) which was relocated by the Municipal authorities a few
months ago. There is hope that the authorities will allow the vendors to come back and set up the
street the way it was but for now all the vendors have relocated from there.)
Must-have:
Special South-Indian fare – Akki Roti / Ragi Roti / Paniyaram or paddus / Kodu Bele
Special South-Indian sweet paranthas – Dal / Hollige
Hot Jalebis / Gulab Jamun
Bhajjis and Bondas
Gulkun Ice-cream

Do-try:
 Regular South-Indian Tiffin – Dosas and Uttapams (made with generous amounts of pure ghee),
Idli, Vadas, Lemon Rice, Curd Rice, Vermicelli Upma
